# PythonScripts
Scripts nowone will probably ever use but I wrote while Im taking the OSCP.

# DNSZONETRANSFER.PY

This script will attempt a DNS zone file transfer with any domain you give it. Good for enumaration. Currently tested only on Unix. Easily modified to work on windows.

# Python generation based fuzzer

you would use this in conjuction with a debugger to get a general appx of when the buffer gets overflowed . you should keep modifying this in conjuction with some tools in msf.
